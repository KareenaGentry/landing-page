      <p id="vision"> “My people will live in peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of rest.” Homes for Haiti follows Christ’s calling to heal the afflicted and care for the poor by turning trash into housing, offering employment which grows self worth, and transforming whole villages from a few hospitable homes, which allows people to become their full selves by living into who God has called them to be.  By this act of love, the people live in a rich relationship with the father and thriving communities are created.</p>
      <p id="homes"> Our first project is to build 1,000 homes in Haiti using waste materials. This will be done through the partnership with EcoDom. </p>
